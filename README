CarryOn - Pack your Python script with its dependencies

Carryon appends a ZIP archive with all dependencies to your script, making it
self-contained while still being a valid Python script.

Not a heavyweight solution like PyInstaller and other "checked luggage" tools.
It still requires a python interpreter.

The script portion can still be edited after packaging - just ensure your editor
preserves binary data and doesn't add a newline at EOF (e.g. vim -b)
